# Bit

Bit is a distributed virtual component repository designed for easy use, maintenance and discovery of code components.

With Bit, you can virtually create and model components on a [distributed Scope](https://teambit.github.io/bit/bit-scope.html), then discover and use these components to dynamically compose a virtual API with the components you actually use in your application.  

It helps reusing code components in different contexts (repositories, micro-services, serverless functions, etc.) without the overhead of maintaining many small packages with different boilerplates or pulling redundant code.  

Components are stored and managed in [Scopes](Glossary#scopes).

Scopes takes care of your components entire lifecycle from storing and version management, through build and test execution all the way to faster dependency management. It also makes your components easy to find with a built-in semantic search and a simple scoping mechanism.
