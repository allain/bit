Bit is a distributed and virtual code component repository designed to be language agnostic.  

With Bit, you can virtually create and model components on a [distributed Scope](https://teambit.github.io/bit/bit-scope.html), then discover and use these components to dynamically compose a virtual API with the components you actually use in your application.  

It helps resuing code components in different contexts (repositories, micro-services, serverless functions, etc.) without the overhead of maintaining many small packages with different boilerplates or pulling redundant code.

## Features

- **Scope.** A Scope is a distributed dynamic codebase responsible for end-to-end management of code components. Scopes are where components are stored, tested, built and integrate with each other.

- **Dynamic and virtual API.** Define the components you need in your application to form a dynamic API made of these components alone, without pulling any redundant code or irrelevant dependencies. 

- **Component environment.** Transpiling and testing are done by simply using other Bit components (compiler and tester), which you can reuse while creating any component with any superset or a testing framework in any context.

- **Fast and predictable depednency resolution.** Dependency resolution is performed on component export, so Bit doesn't have to perform any runtime resolution. This makes the use of components predictable, fast and always available.

- **Discoverability.** Bit has an integrated search engine that uses expressive linguistic models to make your components discoverable even when you forget the exact name you gave each component.
